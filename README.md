Contributing
------------

It's fairly easy to contribute a new game, and anything is appreciated! 

Before you do anything, look at the examples under **examples/** to get a feel of 
how an entry is laid out.

The easiest to create a new entry is by using the wizard. Either:

- Download the EXE under the **Releases** tab, or

- Download **create_yaml.py** and run the script directly. Requires **PyYAML** (pip install pyyaml)

Alternatively, you can write an entry manually in a text editor.

When you're done, upload the resulting .yaml file to GitHub or email it to me at **strata8@outlook.com**
